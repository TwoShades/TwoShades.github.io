# Projects

## Waddle Runner
Imagine a penguin on a mission for fish and fancy hats - that’s the vibe of “Waddle Runner,” a game I cooked up using Unity and C#.

## A Fool’s Quest
A 2D turn-based RPG that took us on an epic journey of game architecture, design patterns, and all the cool tools like Tilemap, Animator, and Input Manager.

## Spooky Security Camera Game
Players will need their wits about them to identify anomalies and report back.
