# About Samuel Rivest

Hey there! I’m Samuel Rivest, a Game Developer with a knack for Mobile App wizardry based in the vibrant city of Montreal.

## Game Dev Playground 🎮
Imagine a penguin on a mission for fish and fancy hats - that’s the vibe of “Waddle Runner,” a game I cooked up using Unity and C#.

## Mobile Magic 📱
When I’m not lost in the game dev universe, I’m crafting mobile apps that bring ideas to life.

## Learning and Growing 🌱
Constantly learning, whether it’s optimizing MongoDB schemas for AWS applications or picking up Pixel Art skills.

## Life Beyond the Screen 🌍
Off-screen, I’m a gamer and a bit of a nerd. I enjoy hiking and traveling.
