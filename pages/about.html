    <h1>About Samuel Rivest</h1>

    <p>Hey there! I’m Samuel Rivest, a Game Developer with a knack for Mobile App wizardry based in the vibrant city of Montreal.</p>

    <h2>Game Dev Playground 🎮</h2>
    <p>Imagine a penguin on a mission for fish and fancy hats - that’s the vibe of “Waddle Runner,” a game I cooked up using Unity and C#.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Magic 📱</h2>
    <p>When I’m not lost in the game dev universe, I’m crafting mobile apps that bring ideas to life.</p>

    <h2>Learning and Growing 🌱</h2>
    <p>Constantly learning, whether it’s optimizing MongoDB schemas for AWS applications or picking up Pixel Art skills.</p>

    <h2>Life Beyond the Screen 🌍</h2>
    <p>Off-screen, I’m a gamer and a bit of a nerd. I enjoy hiking and traveling.</p>
