# 🚀 Samuel Rivest - Game Developer & Mobile App Enthusiast

Hey there! I'm Samuel Rivest, a Game Developer with a knack for Mobile App wizardry based in the vibrant city of Montreal.

## Game Dev Playground 🎮

Imagine a penguin on a mission for fish and fancy hats - that's the vibe of "Waddle Runner," a game I cooked up using Unity and C#. Then there's "A Fool's Quest," a 2D turn-based RPG that took us on an epic journey of game architecture, design patterns, and all the cool tools like Tilemap, Animator, and Input Manager.

Currently, I'm diving into the mysterious realm of a spooky security camera game. Players will need their wits about them to identify anomalies and report back. And hold onto your hats because I'm gearing up to learn Pixel Art for a 2D top-down Cowboy game. Yeehaw! 🤠

## Mobile Magic 📱

When I'm not lost in the game dev universe, I'm crafting mobile apps that bring ideas to life. From comprehensive plans for biochemistry mobile apps to designing user interfaces that just feel right, I love the challenge of making apps as engaging as your favorite game.

## Learning and Growing 🌱

But hey, it's not all about what's already out there. I'm constantly learning, whether it's optimizing MongoDB schemas for AWS applications or picking up Pixel Art skills for the next big cowboy adventure.

## Life Beyond the Screen 🌍

Off-screen, I'm not just a code enthusiast; I'm a gamer and a bit of a nerd. I really enjoy going on hikes and traveling. Whether it's summiting a peak or exploring new cities, I find inspiration in the real world too.

**Dean's List Achiever** 🏆 at John Abbott College, and always championing diversity and inclusion in everything I do.

So, whether you're a fellow code enthusiast, a gamer, or just someone curious about the magic of pixels and code, welcome aboard! Let's share experiences, learn together, and level up in this exciting journey.

Catch you in the virtual realms! 🚀
